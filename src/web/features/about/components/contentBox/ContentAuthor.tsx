                For several years, I’ve been living and working on the road, but my
                travel addiction started long before that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in Dresden, East Germany, and never considered myself a travel
                expert.
            </p>

                My first trip abroad happened when I was 13; it was a trip to Ireland.
                Apart from cruises and family trips to Egypt and Turkey, I had no
                experience in independent travel.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating from the university, I got a job with a standard
                two-week vacation. I wanted to make the most of that time by exploring
                as much as possible in foreign countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, a vacation wasn’t just about fun; I aimed to learn something new
                about people and places. At that time, my dream was to learn Japanese.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as time passed, I felt unsatisfied with my job, so I decided to
                quit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite planning ahead, neither my relatives nor my girlfriend welcomed
                this decision. Nevertheless, I had no choice but to move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career as an archivist came to an end, and I began learning new
                disciplines that I believed would enable me to travel full-time while
                managing this website, spending 5 to 6 months on the road.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, I embarked on my first solo trip to{' '}
                <b className="bold">Cyprus, </b>which significantly altered my
                perspective on traveling.
