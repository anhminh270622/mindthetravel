					, the travel guides below aim to save your time by providing summaries
					and most up to date information for each particular destination. There
					are not so many guides at the moment, but I do my best to keep this
					list growing. Traveling is a very personal experience. I know that
					every one of us has a different travel style and there is no wrong or
					right way to do it. That is why these travel guides contain only
					general travel tips about places to see, things to do, where to eat
					and average travelling costs.
